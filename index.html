                <!-- MY SHORT BIO -->
                <p>
                    My name is Vitaliy and I am a happy owner of two dogs and a cat. The youngest dog is a beautiful Terrier-mix female. She's trouble. The second dog is named Ugly, but he's actually cute. He's a half-beed Chihuahua in a bad need of an attitude adjustment. The third is the cutest because she is a cat. Shalon is named after a fictional princess, and she definitely carries like one too.

                    Ukraine is my birth country, but since age 11 I lived in the United States. I met and married my Russian wife Lily here in the sunny California.

                <br>
                    Computers and coding have always been an undercurrent of my life. I am psyched to be at the UCD Coding Bootcamp finally learning the indepth skills to code professionally. I can't wait until my first coding job!
